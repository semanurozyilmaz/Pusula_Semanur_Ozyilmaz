```bash
git clone https://github.com/semanurozyilmaz/Pusula_Semanur_Ozyilmaz.git
```

### 2. Choose to Run Locally or on Google Colab
You have two options for running this project:

- Run Locally: You can run the .ipynb file on your local machine using Jupyter Notebook (see below for setup instructions).
- Run on Google Colab: Alternatively, you can upload the .ipynb file to Google Colab and run it directly in your browser without needing to install anything locally. Visit Google Colab and upload the notebook file to start.

### 3. Modify File Path for the .xlsx File
If you're importing an .xlsx file, you'll need to adjust the file path to point to the location of the file on your local machine or Google Colab:

1. Find the path where your .xlsx file is stored on your computer or Google Drive.

- On Windows, it might look like: C:\Users\YourName\Documents\data.xlsx
- On macOS or Linux, it might look like: /Users/YourName/Documents/data.xlsx

2. Modify the file path in the code where you're reading the Excel file.

## Overview of the Project

This project aims to perform data analysis on [drug side effects]. The analysis was conducted on specific datasets, and results were visualized and interpreted to gain insights.

# Methods Used

The data analysis process in this project involved the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Missing and incorrect data were identified and handled using appropriate methods.
   - For example, missing values for gender, weight, and height were filled using average values.
   
2. **Data Visualization**: Data was visualized using various graphs to analyze key trends.
   - For example, side effects were analyzed based on age ranges or drug types.

3. **Data Transformation**: Where necessary, nominal data was transformed into numerical data (e.g., the gender column was encoded).

4. **Statistical Analysis**: Possible relationships in the data were examined, and correlations between drug usage and side effects were calculated.
